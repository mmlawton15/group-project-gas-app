## What is this project?
Gas Guru is an application that looks for the nearest gas stations around the city the user has provided and lists out the prices of of each gas station nad their location, from there they can choose what gas station works for them.

## What is the point of this project?
Cheaper gas! The worst thing is when you get some expensive gas and you drive by another gas station and the gas is cheaper! Every cent counts, we wanted it to be easier to find the cheapest gas around the area so you can save a little bit of money, and also not only can you find the nearest gas station in your area but it also you tells you how the weather will look like on the way there, just anohter way of making your life easier!

## How it works
* When the page is loaded you are presented with a input container to type in the desired zip you want.
* Hit the submit button on the left of the the input container
* You are brought to anohter page where a list of stations will load that are in the area of the zip you have typed in.
* There is also another input container where you can type in a different zip code if you would like without have to go the previous page.
